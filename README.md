# tme-mobile-robot
UW Tacoma Mechatronics mobile robotics platform for education

This repository contains 3D models, a parts list, and example code to build a simple two-wheeled robot. The required components are relatively cheap and easily available. A 3D printer and laser cutter are required to manufacture some components.

The robot can be easily extended and customized to accomplish a wide variety of tasks. The base plate has an array of holes which match the diameter and spacing of standard LEGO and LEGO Technic parts.

The robot platform was developed for TME 441 Mechatronics, a required senior-level course in the Mechanical Engineering program at the University of Washington, Tacoma.
